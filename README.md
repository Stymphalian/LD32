I wanted to make a platformer game where the central mechanic is playing an intstrument to
interact with the environment. The player would play a 5-note song and this would
cause special abilites to activate (i.e telporation, fireball, jump really high etc).
My inspiration was really the ocarina mechanic from "Zelda: Ocarina of Time" as well as
the 'Magicka' magic casting mechanic. I felt it provided me a lot of opprotunities to
be creative (spells,interactive game-play) as well as allow to focus on the audio and graphics
parts of the game.


###To Play:

*A D*  = move left and right
*W*    = Pull out your instrument

*U I O* = Use these keys in order to play music
*J K L*

Spells:

*UUIIO*   = Jump high

*JKLJK*   = Create a teleportation cube

In the end the game I made is really quite in shambles.
The central mechanic didn't feel good at all and I only implemented two spells.
The music and sounds didn't make it into the game.
Very little in terms of UX and UI.

##Painpoints:

* I had a lot of trouble brain-storming ideas for the Theme.
* Not enough prep using Unity. I spent a good deal of time just watching tutorials.
* The graphics were really terrible. I need to practice more ( maybe read tutorials)
on how to make proper pixel art.
* Sounds. A game where the central mechanic is playing an instrument the sounds were
basically non-existent. I need to practice and learn more about my tools before I start
using them.


##Goals/Improvements for next LD.

* Really focus on graphics. I had a lot of fun just drawing the frames for my stick-figure running around,
and I think it turned out looking not too bad.
* Learn my tools before using them. Sound/Music mixer programs I'm looking at you.
